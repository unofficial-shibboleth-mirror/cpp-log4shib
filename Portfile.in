description         configurable logging for C++, fork of log4cpp
long_description    Log4shib is library of C++ classes for flexible logging to \
                    files, syslog, IDSA and other destinations. It is modeled \
                    after the Log4j Java library, staying as close to their \
                    API as is reasonable.
